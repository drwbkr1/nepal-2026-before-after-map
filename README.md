# Nepal 2026 Before/After Map

An evidence-first geospatial project to produce a reproducible, ArcGIS-ready before-and-after map of the 26 August 2026 debris avalanche and flash flood in Nepal's Langtang–Bhote Koshi–Trishuli corridor.

## Proposed long-term goal

Build and maintain a defensible geospatial evidence package that shows where the event altered the landscape, distinguishes direct satellite observations from interpretation, and can be opened, reviewed, updated, and exported in ArcGIS Pro without relying on undocumented analyst state.

The project should ultimately deliver:

- a projected ArcGIS Pro project in **WGS 1984 UTM Zone 45N (EPSG:32645)**;
- registered before/after optical and radar imagery with source manifests and checksums;
- mapped change features with confidence, method, date, and source attributes;
- overview, source-area, and corridor map layouts;
- portable ArcGIS layer and project packages plus GeoTIFF, GeoPackage/File Geodatabase, PDF, and PNG exports;
- a public, reproducible method record that preserves limitations and failed or inconclusive analytical routes.

This goal is **proposed, not activated**. The repository bootstrap does not authorize imagery acquisition, terms acceptance, high-resolution commercial imagery use, or publication of scientific conclusions.

## Why this is useful

Emergency maps often mix source discovery, visual interpretation, and final cartography in ways that are hard to audit later. This project separates those stages. A reviewer should be able to trace a mapped change back to an exact satellite product, processing step, observation date, and confidence statement.

## Initial study design

| Component | Initial choice |
|---|---|
| Event | 26 August 2026 Nepal debris avalanche and flash flood |
| Study corridor | Langtang source area through the Bhote Koshi–Trishuli corridor |
| Master CRS | EPSG:32645, WGS 1984 UTM Zone 45N |
| Core optical | Sentinel-2 Level-2A, 12 Aug and 27 Aug 2026 |
| Core radar | Sentinel-1 GRD, ascending and descending before/after pairs |
| GIS target | ArcGIS Pro 3.7+ |
| Public core | Copernicus products and reproducible metadata |
| Optional high resolution | Separate, license-gated, noncommercial path only |

The product identifiers currently under consideration are recorded in [docs/DATA_AND_METHODS_PLAN.md](docs/DATA_AND_METHODS_PLAN.md). They are candidates until coverage, rights, pixels, masks, and event relevance are verified.

## Repository boundaries

This public repository stores project controls, methods, small scripts, source manifests, and lightweight review evidence. It does **not** store raw satellite archives, extracted SAFE products, large rasters, geodatabases, ArcGIS project packages, credentials, access tokens, or licensed imagery. Those belong in controlled local or external data custody.

Public visibility does not grant reuse rights to third-party data. No repository license has been selected yet.

## Current checkpoint

Milestone 0 bootstraps the public project and validates its control records. The next proposed milestone is to confirm the event geometry and create a locked source manifest using metadata and quicklooks before downloading full scenes.

- [Data and methods plan](docs/DATA_AND_METHODS_PLAN.md)

## Validate the repository

From the repository root:

```powershell
python scripts/check_project.py
```

The check verifies required control files, parses the JSON records, and rejects tracked secrets and large geospatial artifacts.
